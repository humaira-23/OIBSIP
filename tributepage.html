        <p class="title">Biography</p>
        <p class="desp">A.P.J. Abdul Kalam served as president of the Republic of India from 2002 to 2007. As president, Kalam promoted the advancement of the national nuclear weapons program. Kalam also devised a 20-year action plan to achieve economic growth through technological development in India. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam attended the Madras Institute of Technology, where he received a degree in aeronautical engineering in 1960. After graduation he joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)—an Indian military research institute—and later the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Kalam’s associations were not limited to research organizations: he was also associated with political groups, such as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). A.P.J. Abdul Kalam created the Technology Vision 2020 project in 1998. The project sought to develop India’s economy through technology, particularly as applied to agriculture, and increase the availability of health care and education. In recognition of Kalam’s services to the country and broad popularity, the National Democratic Alliance nominated him for president in 2002.</p>
